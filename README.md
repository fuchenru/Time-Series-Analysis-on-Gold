# Time Series Analysis on Gold

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict the gold price using various time series analysis methods. Gold has historically been a valuable asset, influenced by various factors, and has served as a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation. By applying the time series analysis techniques learned in class, we aim to accurately predict or analyze the gold price.

## Models Used

1. **ARIMAX (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous variables)**: Integrates autoregressive and moving average components with exogenous variables, providing a robust framework for capturing complex relationships.
2. **Drift Method**: Assumes a constant trend over time.
3. **Prophet Model**: Leverages an additive approach to handle seasonality and holidays.
4. **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)**: Used for volatility forecasting, capturing the time-varying nature of volatility in the data.

These methods collectively offer comprehensive insights into the underlying patterns and future trends of the gold price time series.
